\format{
A data frame with 64 rows and 9 variables:
\describe{
\item{Block}{Block - 4 levels}
\item{A}{handwheel diameter - 2 levels (5.5 or 10 in)}
\item{B}{dial diameter - 2 levels (4 or 8 in)}

\item{D}{friction of the spindle - 2 levels (7.5 or 45 lb.-in)}
\item{E}{level of operator's elbow relative to height of handwheel - 2 levels (level or above)}
\item{F}{previous experience of operator - 2 levels (practiced or nonpracticed)}
\item{G}{knowledge of accuracy of previous setting - 2 levels (feedback or no feedback)}
\item{LogS}{Response variable: log of sample variance of 25 repeated observations
for a particular treatment combination}

An experiment for finding the design of a machine tool handwheel that would
maximize the accuracy on the part of the operator in the setting of the machine tool handwheel. (Chapter 15, Table 15.48)
