Response variables studied: Mean yields (kg/h) over 3 different harvests

Factors: N, K, Compost, and Seaweed. 

Design: A $2^4$ single replicate was employed .

    rename(Seaweed=A, Compost=B, K=C, N=A) |>
    mutate(Yield = c(1738, 2196, 1864, 1742, 2046, 2154, 1530, 2364, 
        2166, 1890, 2068, 2572, 1720, 2442, 1756, 2020))
